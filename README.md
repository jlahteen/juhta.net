You may wonder what the word ”juhta” means? It’s a Finnish word and means “beast of burden” in English, that is, an animal such as a mule or donkey that is used for carrying loads. So in the application development world it's a metaphor for a solid and robust app framework. The word is also very close to the author’s first name which gives it another association.
